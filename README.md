# Example of dynamically adding navigation line in the Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC Maps component

In this ASP.NET MVC project, we created a sample to show how to add the navigation line dynamically in the Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC Maps component.

In this sample, we created a button labelled **Add NavigationLine**. When this button is clicked, we can dynamically update the [navigationLineSettings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Maps.MapsNavigationLine.html) in the [layers](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Maps.MapsLayer.html) of the Maps component and refresh the Maps. Now, the navigation line is added dynamically to the Maps.
