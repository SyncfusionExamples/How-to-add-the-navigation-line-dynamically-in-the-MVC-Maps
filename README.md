# Example of dynamically adding a navigation line in the Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC Maps component

In this ASP.NET MVC project, we created a sample to show how to add the navigation line dynamically in the Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC Maps component.

In this sample, we have included a button "**Add NavigationLine**". When this button is clicked, we can dynamically update the [navigationLineSettings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Maps.MapsNavigationLine.html) in the [layers](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Maps.MapsLayer.html) of the Maps component and call the refresh method of the Maps. Now, a navigation line will be added dynamically to the Maps.
